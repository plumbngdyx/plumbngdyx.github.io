It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational use, water pressure pushes the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard versus back pressure.

Set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different design from the one we show, inspect the directions. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
