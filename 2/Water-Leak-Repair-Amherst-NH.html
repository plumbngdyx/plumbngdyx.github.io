<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly.

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system must be continually kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
