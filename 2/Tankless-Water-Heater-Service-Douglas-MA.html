<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
