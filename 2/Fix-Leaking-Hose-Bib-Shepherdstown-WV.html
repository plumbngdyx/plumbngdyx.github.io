<p>If you start to observe lower water pressure in your sink or shower, this might be an indication of rust and mineral accumulation which will slowly start to block the flow of water through your pipes.

<p>While the majority of plumbers anticipate payment on the day of service, or in a timely manner once they have actually sent out an invoice, lots of plumbing contractors require that you pay a deposit upfront.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks drinks. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
