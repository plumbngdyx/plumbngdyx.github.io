When corrosion accumulates within your pipes, water output for showers, sinks, and other components is greatly lowered.</p>

However while small drips should not be cause for concern, property owners should watch on the water heater leaks.

All possible or existing cross connections must be secured from backflow by the installation of a proper backflow prevention device. Consult Public Health for more specific details on code requirements.</p>
