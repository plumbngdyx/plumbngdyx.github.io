<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver female believed the price she spent for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a couple of things in a different way could have saved her a lot of cash. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then unfavorable or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
