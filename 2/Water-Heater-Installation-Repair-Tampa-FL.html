<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it challenging to gain access to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge task, replacing exposed pipes in a basement, crawlspace, or utility  room is relatively simple, because the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets need to definitely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>
