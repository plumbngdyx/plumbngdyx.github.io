<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
