Read our evaluations to see what people are saying about our water heater services. It might be time to get it replaced if your water heater has actually needed multiple repairs over the last few years. A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the life-span of the average hot water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your water heater.</p>
<p>To link a power cord to the new system, remove the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires discovered inside with their equivalents in the cord, using wire nuts.

If you have 2 meters, drinkable and watering, you are likewise required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
