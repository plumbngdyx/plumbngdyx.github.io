<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>

To avoid this, make sure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation kit consists of a tube, or buy one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
