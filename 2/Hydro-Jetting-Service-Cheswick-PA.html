This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is necessary to get rid of the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its style and absence of moving parts. Nevertheless, it might be unwise in many scenarios to install a pipe sector of this length.
