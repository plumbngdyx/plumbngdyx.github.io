<p>Backflow prevention devices are designed to safeguard the general public water supply from cross-connections. A modern neighborhood water supply system is designed to guarantee that water streams to residential or commercial properties and structures under pressure. If there is a cross-connection between the water supply and a contaminated source, this community water network contains numerous users where there is a danger to public health.

Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash market. Typically, the savings have actually been based mostly on minimizing chemical and cleaning agent costs. While those cost savings are still significant, new commercial softening innovation utilizing multi-tank systems (MTS) also provides substantial water and salt cost savings.</p>
<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
