<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Lancaster MA</h3>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner package. The total repair bill might remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can position problems.</p>
