<p>A RainSoft water conditioner can help your water heater last longer. Prior to salt starts working in a water softener it needs a little home time within the tank, because the salt is dissolving slowly. When one right away starts regrowth after including salt to the reservoir, the water softener may not work according to requirements. After an approval of strategies has been provided and the assembly has been set up, it must be tested by a certified tester. The designer (or water provider) is then responsible to certify that the installation was performed in accordance with approved strategies; or describe any changes or submit "As Built" plans as proper.</p>
<p>This ion exchange process is helped with by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. This is another mix that can work on sink clogs. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mixture sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water. If it doesn't work the first time, you can repeat this procedure. We do hot water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>

Baffles: Baffles prevent flatware from going into the garbage disposal, so you're only sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
