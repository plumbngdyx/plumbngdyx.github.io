I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
