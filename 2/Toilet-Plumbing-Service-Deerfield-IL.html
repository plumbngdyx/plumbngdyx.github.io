<p>In the long run, a gas heater may be a cheaper choice than an electric, but the preliminary cost of the heater and the installation can be substantially greater. A gas heater likewise requires a bit more to appropriately maintain for many years than an electric heater will.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a procedure called ion exchange to get rid of difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical process referred to as Template Assisted Condensation (TAC).

Salt-free softeners are also referred to as water conditioners since they do not really soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And since these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to remove captured ions.</p>
