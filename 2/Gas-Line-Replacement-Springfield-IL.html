<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>

<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Springfield IL</h3>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
