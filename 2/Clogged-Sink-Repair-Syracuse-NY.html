<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be tested annually. Likewise allows provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be tested annually to insure the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
