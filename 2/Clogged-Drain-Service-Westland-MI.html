<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many designated usages around your house.</p>
