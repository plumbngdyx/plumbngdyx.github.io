Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
