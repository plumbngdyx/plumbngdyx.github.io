<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
