It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring incantations to the drain gods.</p>

While gas leakages are unusual, you need to get out of the structure immediately if you discover an odor like rotten eggs in your home. A gas leak can have nearly instant results on those exposed to it, and it can even be deadly. If you've got a gas pipe leaking, get out of the house and call us instantly.</p>
