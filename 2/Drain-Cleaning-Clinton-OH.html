<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
