<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
