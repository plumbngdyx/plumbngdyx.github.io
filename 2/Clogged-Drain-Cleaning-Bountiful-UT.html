<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
