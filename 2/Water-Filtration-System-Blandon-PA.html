That's a term scientists use to describe highly pure water, because if it doesn't have some impurities in it, it will tend to leach other chemicals out of whatever container it is in. That might be okay, if your water is stored in glass, but if it's stored in plastic, then the water could be leaching plastic, and you could be drinking it.">
