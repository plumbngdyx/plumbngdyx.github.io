Replacing potassium chloride for salt chloride might be suitable if health or environmental factors require limiting sodium. In time, the beads end up being covered with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning procedure, called regrowth, has three cycles: recharge, rinse and backwash. The regrowth process can be set up instantly with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
<p>This ion exchange procedure is helped with by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with salt ions. This is another combination that can deal with sink blockages. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mix sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water.
