<p>So, how does a softener know when to come down to service? The timing of regrowth depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water actually requires it. When required, more recent units use electronic sensing units that keep an eye on bead exhaustion and other essential metrics based on your water usage and therefore just restore. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect because they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
