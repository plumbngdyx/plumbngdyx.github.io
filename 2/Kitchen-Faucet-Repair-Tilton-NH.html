Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions.

<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Tilton NH</h3>
<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
