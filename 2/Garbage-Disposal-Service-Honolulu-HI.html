<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, use never ever exactly matches supply.
