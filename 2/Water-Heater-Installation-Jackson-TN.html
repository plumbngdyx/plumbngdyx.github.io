For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it hard to access to in-wall pipes, think about at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

Toilets must absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

For this reason, the RPZ should be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and enable adequate drainage.</p>
