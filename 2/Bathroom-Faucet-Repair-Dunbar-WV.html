<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it challenging to access to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big task, changing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, basement, or energy  room is fairly simple, since the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets ought to absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet ought to be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>
