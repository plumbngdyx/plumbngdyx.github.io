<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily stored for later use when need rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
