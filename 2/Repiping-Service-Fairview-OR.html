I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
