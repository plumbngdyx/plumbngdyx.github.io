In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly.
