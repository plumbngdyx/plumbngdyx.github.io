Popping noises, for example, show that the water is boiling (which ought to never occur). Sediment build-up or a faulty thermostat represent typical reasons for boiling water. Water naturally consists of the minerals that can contribute to problems with a water heater, and areas with hard water might need more frequent flushes or service.</p>
