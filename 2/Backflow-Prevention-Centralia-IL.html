<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
