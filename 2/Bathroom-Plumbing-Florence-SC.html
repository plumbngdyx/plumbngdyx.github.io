If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home.

A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). Examine the directions if your valve is a various design from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), link the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
