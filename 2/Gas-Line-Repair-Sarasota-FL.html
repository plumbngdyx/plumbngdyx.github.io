<p>Search for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow backwards into the city water lines.</p>

When we take out the existing toilet one has installed we willcheck all the plumbing lines to guarantee they remain in good condition.

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to help avoid leaks and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to split and solidify or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the area in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We highly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
