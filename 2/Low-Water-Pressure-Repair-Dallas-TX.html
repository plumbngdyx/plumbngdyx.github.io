<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
