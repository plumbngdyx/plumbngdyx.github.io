<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. This big amount of garbage does not need to enter the trash bin if it can quickly and quickly be disposed of through the sink. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without impeding water flow. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by saving the amount of trash that gets sent out to land fills and other discarding locations. With a garbage disposal the trash is managed through currently existing water facilities.</p>

Excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
