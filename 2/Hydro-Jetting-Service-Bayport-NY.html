It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Often a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk.

Backflow preventers block any water from negative or back pressure in your watering system at shutdown from getting in back into your water source, therefore minimizing the risk of contamination of your water source. Many municipalities require the use of an authorized backflow preventer in drip watering systems. You may want to talk to your local municipality before installing your irrigation system.</p>
