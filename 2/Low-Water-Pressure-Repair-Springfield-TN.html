If your house was constructed before the 1970s, we strongly advise that you employ a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. If your home was constructed years prior to that, possibilities are that your home may need substantial repiping so that your house's plumbing can function at optimum rates.</p>

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily saved for later use when need rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
