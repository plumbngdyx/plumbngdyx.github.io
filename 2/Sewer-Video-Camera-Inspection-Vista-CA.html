<h3>Clogged Bathtub Drain in Vista California</h2>
<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it must be restored (cleaned up). Salt is usually used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
