<p>Atmospheric vacuum breaker. Although you may have a number of atmospheric vacuum breakers on your system, the water will just flow through among them on its way to the sprinklers or emitters.

When needed, newer units use electronic sensing units that monitor bead exhaustion and other key metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only regrow. These newer systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal since they conserve energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
