<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>
