<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
