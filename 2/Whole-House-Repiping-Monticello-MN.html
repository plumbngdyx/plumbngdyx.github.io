<h3>How to Repair Kitchen Faucets in Monticello MN</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
<p>In addition to the specific facilities noted above, an approved backflow prevention assembly must be set up on each safe and clean water service connection to any facilities including a real or potential  hazard.

The minimum approved backflow prevention assembly for unlisted risks will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Cross Connection Control Program.</p>
