<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force.

That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high risk" facilities.</p>
