<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never ever precisely matches supply.
