<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally regrow after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are convenient if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
