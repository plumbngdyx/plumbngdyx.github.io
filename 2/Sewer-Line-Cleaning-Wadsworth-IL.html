We have state-of-the-art devices to accurately determine what plumbing solution will be required, including drain snakes, video cameras, and rooters. In some cases a plumbing issue is more than simply a leaky faucet - often it's a pipe issue. If you have actually seen your pipes making loud or odd noises (among the most typical is a hammering sound), call one of our sink repair experts. We'll take a look at the circumstance and if we find that your pipes are old, we might recommend a replacement. We'll repair it as rapidly as possible if we find that it's just a leak or a fitting problem.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the best length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to place the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To prevent this, make sure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation set includes a tube, or buy one individually at the very same time for about $3.</p>
