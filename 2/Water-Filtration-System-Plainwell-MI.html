The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems. There are a variety of methods house owners can unclog a kitchen sink, consisting of utilizing a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or using an option of vinegar and baking soda. For the more serious clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common.
