Today, it's estimated that over 50% of American households have a garbage disposal in their kitchen. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus provides you an optional Pipe Security Plan for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, readily available, natural gas pipes running from the gas meter to your gas devices.</p>

<p>The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; additional, more considerable expenses can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for locals.

Indoor gas leaks from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning appliances take place most typically in the winter. This is because houses are not properly aerated during the cooler months to prevent heat loss. We recommend setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to notify you of any potential gas leakages if you have not done so currently.</p>
