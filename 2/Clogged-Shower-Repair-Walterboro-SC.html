<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 typically depending upon the length from the main gas line. Setting up a gas line for a grill costs $99 to $600, while a fire pit that's out in the backyard costs $300 to $1,400. You might have an issue with high water pressure if your water heater stops working due to sediment build up in the tank. The water pressure builds and may ultimately cause the tank to take off. This causes thousands of dollars in water and home damage to your house.</p>
<p>A decrease in supply side pressure brought on by an occurrence such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Examine Valve allows the excess customer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge up until the supply side pressure again exceeds the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
