Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
