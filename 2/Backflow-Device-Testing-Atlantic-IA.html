<p>Having tough water makes life ... well, hard. But you don't need to go for scratchy clothing and spotty dishes. Adding a water softener to your home indicates sparkling meals, cleaner laundry, shinier hair, and appliances that last and last.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
