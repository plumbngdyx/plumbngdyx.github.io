<p>If your disposal is clogged, don't use harsh drain cleaning chemicals to attempt to unclog the unit. Chemicals can damage the mechanical parts, reducing the life of the disposal. Water leakages: If you discover a leak in your pipes, there might be other leakages you are unaware of. Leaks are a sure sign that your pipes are worn and old and need to be changed. Rather than having to continuously repair them, the very best alternative. is to replace them.</p>
<p>The other distinction in between continuous feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals just squash the food in batches (thus the name)-- not all at once like a continuous feed garbage disposal. If there is a leak, one thing to know about gas lines is they can be exceptionally harmful. While gas leakages are rare, you need to get out of the structure right away if you see an odor like rotten eggs in your residential or commercial property. A gas leak can have almost instant effects on those exposed to it, and it can even be fatal. If you've got a gas pipe leaking, get out of your house and call us instantly.</p>
