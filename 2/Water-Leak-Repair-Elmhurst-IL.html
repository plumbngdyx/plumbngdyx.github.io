<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
