Water heater need to be provided by High 5 Plumbing.</p>

This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
