<p>A typical water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drainpipe or drywell. From brand-new bathroom fixtures to custom-made countertops, we genuinely have everything. Our stock makes us the very best plumbing company for any task in Seattle, WA.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a procedure called ion exchange to remove tough water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical process known as Template Assisted Condensation (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a solidity crystal that won't adhere to any surface area in your home, keeping your appliances and hot water heaters devoid of difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are likewise known as water conditioners because they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it. And because these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to get rid of recorded ions.</p>
