<p>Backflow is bad news. Clamp the drain hose. The water softener requires to drain the depleted salt water option after the regeneration cycle. Secure the drain hose firmly and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning drainage, all drain pipes need to have an air gap. The end of the hose be at least two inches above the dedicated drain. An air gap may be used to achieve this, and might be needed depending on local plumbing codes.</p>
<p>The typical service is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced: whole-house repiping.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, but steel eventually experiences deterioration and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
