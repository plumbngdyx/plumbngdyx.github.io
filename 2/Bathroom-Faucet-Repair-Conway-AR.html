Age-- As we discussed, a 10+ year old hot water heater is probably on its last legs.

Normally, the first 2 numbers indicate the year of your water heater.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's always easier to avoid clogs in the first place. Don't overload it if you have a kitchen garbage disposal. Feed items in a little at a time, and wait till they run and grind through completely before including more. Never put bacon grease, coffee grounds or oils down your kitchen drain, and constantly make certain you run a lot of thin down the drain after each use. It's important to know how to care and keep for your all your home's plumbing elements and systems to keep things running smoothly.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the problem if this is the case. You may have to check out using a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.</p>
