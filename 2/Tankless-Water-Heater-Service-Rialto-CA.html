<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is essential to conquer the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simpleness of its design and lack of moving parts. However, it may be not practical in numerous situations to install a pipe section of this length. Furthermore, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
