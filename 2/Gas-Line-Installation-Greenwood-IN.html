When turned on, your disposal unit takes down wastewater and any product particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly flow into the drain pipe in addition to the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Unnoticed water leaks might lead to mold development. Plumbers typically replace outdoor gas piping with continuous, waterproof, flexible polyethylene gas piping with risers at the pipe entry and exit points to keep water out of the system.
