<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made of copper.

The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
