In a separate drain path, small pipes range from the tub and sink to ultimately meet up with a bigger one beneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the home. A great method to decrease the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a waste disposal unit. Rapidly and efficiently eliminating remaining potato peels, fruit rinds and many other kinds of food waste, the disposal grinds all of it into great particles that are flushed out of the chamber and into the house drainage, waste and vent system or what you probably call your sewer.</p>
