<p>Standpipe systems are utilized in many facilities, these systems are created to supply water to fire hose connections or hose cabinets tactically set up inside a building.

The 2nd type is a wet standpipe system which is normally connected to the buildings potable water supply and requires the installation of a check valve assembly.</p>
<p>An air pressure test is needed. The test pressure will be at least 1 1/2 times the working pressure, however no less than 3 pounds per square inch (psi). The test duration shall not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall stand up to the test pressure defined without showing any proof of leakage or other flaws. Mechanical assesses used to determine test pressures will have a variety such that the highest end of the scale is not higher than five times the test pressure. For example, a 3 psi test will require an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test could be carried out utilizing a 50 pound gauge, however not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not show the minimum pressure needed for the test, or any decrease of test pressures as shown by pressure assesses during inspection shall be considered to suggest the existence of a leak.</p>
