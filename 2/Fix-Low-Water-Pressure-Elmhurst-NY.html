<p>In this scenario, unclean water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Double flush valves are ending up being increasingly more typical, as both manufacturers and consumers seek brand-new methods to conserve water. Double flush toilets enable the user to pick the level of water required to flush the toilet based on whether the waste is solid or liquid. We've all heard the old expression, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down." Well, lots of people find that squicky - and so the dual flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're simply using less water to do it.</p>
