<p>Lubrication may assist with the placement of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any much better, it is just there to assist the service technician assemble the components into the body without producing damage from friction. The lubricant should be a food grade lube to guarantee the water system is not infected. In most cases the best lubricant is water.

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance.

That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high threat" establishments.</p>
