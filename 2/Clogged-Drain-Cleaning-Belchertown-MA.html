Even professional plumbers often attempt two or three flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a process called ion exchange to get rid of difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical process called Design template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This procedure converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a solidity crystal that won't stay with any surface in your home, keeping your devices and hot water heaters free of tough water scale build up.

And since these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to get rid of captured ions.</p>
