Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
