<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
