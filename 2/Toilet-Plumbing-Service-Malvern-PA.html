Atmos Energy does not preserve the gas lines on your property beyond our meter, this is the exact same as other energies, such as your electrical wiring and water pipes.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to turn off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the directions if your valve is a various design from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
