<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 stages. In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and eliminated. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to remove any remaining pollutants.</p>
