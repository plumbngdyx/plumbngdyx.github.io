I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
