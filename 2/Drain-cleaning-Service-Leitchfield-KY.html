Subsequently residential permits provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be checked yearly. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an annually test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to operating the watering system.
