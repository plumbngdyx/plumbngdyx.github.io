Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>A water hardness test would not show a lowered firmness. How do I understand it's working? The FutureSoft is a salt-free system that does not pull out the hardness to replace them with sodium.

You will no longer have the drawback to difficult water, i.e., scaling, clogging and etching of aerators while maintaining the advantageous minerals. Likewise, since the minerals are not being taken out of the water, you will not be lowering the pH, which can trigger water to end up being acidic assisting it to remain alkaline which is extremely advantageous for you and your house.</p>
