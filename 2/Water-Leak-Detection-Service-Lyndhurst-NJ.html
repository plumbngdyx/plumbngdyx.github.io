<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>
