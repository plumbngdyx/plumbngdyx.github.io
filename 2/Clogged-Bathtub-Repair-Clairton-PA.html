These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener lie in the control valve or softener head as it is typically described. Most popular water softeners have an automatic regenerating system.  The most fundamental type has an electrical timer that flushes and recharges the system on a regular schedule.</p>
