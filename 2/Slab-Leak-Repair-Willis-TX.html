If this occurs only when your hot water is running, it might be due to a rusty warm water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your home.</p>
<p>In local water supply systems, water is generally maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your home or company. When the pressure drops for some reason such as might happen when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to fight a water or a fire main breaks or some other situation takes place, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an occurrence, there requires to be some kind of backflow prevention technique made use of.
