<p>A PVB needs to be installed 12 inches above the highest emission point. The benefit of this device is that you can install multiple zone valves in valve boxes underground after the device. However, if there are several leaks within the system, or if there is proof of deterioration in a number of locations, it is probably time to repipe.

After that the softener can be detached, transferred to its new location and put there.
