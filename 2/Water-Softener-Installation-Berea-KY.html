The test shall consist of questions about general trade understanding of plumbing and standard code requirements.

<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily stored for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
