<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 indicators of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect in time, they slowly start to constrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you observe it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, affecting your water quality.</p>
