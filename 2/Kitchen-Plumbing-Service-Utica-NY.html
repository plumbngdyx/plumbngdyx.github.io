Depending on the level of care and maintenance carried out on it, your water heater will last between 10-15 years. After that, you might start to observe a lapse in performance. The quality of your water system will likewise affect the longevity of your system; as pointed out previously, neglected tough water will ultimately use down on your water heater and cause it to deteriorate much more rapidly.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
