<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
