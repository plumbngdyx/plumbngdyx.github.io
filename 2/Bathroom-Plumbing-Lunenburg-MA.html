<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might occur. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not effectively protected, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be pushed into the drinkable supply system. Backflow Preventer meaning: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite direction.</p>
