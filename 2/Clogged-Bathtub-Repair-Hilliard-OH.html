<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
