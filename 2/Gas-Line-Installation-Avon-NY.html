<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
