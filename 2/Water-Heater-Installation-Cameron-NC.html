<p>Run the hot water. Warm water is your pal, particularly for your kitchen sink. Even if you are really mindful with what you put down your sinks, food remnants and cooking oils still leave down our drains - especially the kitchen sink.

Channeling occurs when the incoming hard water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.
