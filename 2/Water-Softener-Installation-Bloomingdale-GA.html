But is a plumbing catastrophe impending or simply a concern for the distant future? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom home costs $4,000 to $10,000, and needs cutting open walls and floorings, so you definitely don't want to do the job before it's needed. Here's how to examine your plumbing system and understand when it's time for replacement. They also must be set up a minimum of six inches above the greatest emission point.

If you water with potable water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, drinkable and irrigation, you are also needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>Kenny came out and did an amazing job unclogging my storm drain. He identified the problem and was able to return and jet it out.

If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
