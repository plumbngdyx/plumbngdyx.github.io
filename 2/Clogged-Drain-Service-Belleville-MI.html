<p>The typical cost for trenchless pipe repair is usually around $6,000-$ 12,000, while dig-and-replace repairs are normally between $4,000-$ 13,000 (the larger cost range accounting for manual digging, depth and pipe area).

<p>Faulty parts: If you have an electrical hot water heater, a defective thermostat or a tripped breaker can cause problems. If you have a gas unit, the pilot light might go out, leading to little or no warm water. In basic, standard hot water heater are expected to last 7-10 years with appropriate maintenance. If you're moving into a brand-new home, inspect the age of the existing hot water heater.
