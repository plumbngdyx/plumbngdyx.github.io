<p>The term hard water refers to water with a high mineral content. These minerals can differ depending on which area of the country you're in, but many frequently consist of calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates. Difficult water does not start hard-- instead, it gets mineral deposits as it is available in contact with limestone underground. These mineral deposits remain when the water is routed into pipes for residential and commercial use, unless the water is softened or filtered.</p>
<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a danger to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
