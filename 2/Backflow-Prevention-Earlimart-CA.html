Usually, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires total water shut off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience minimal disturbance to your day-to-day routine.

Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content.

More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
