<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Danielsville GA!</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a nuisance-- for its numerous intended usages around your house.</p>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most house centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
