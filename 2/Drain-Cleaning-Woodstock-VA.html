Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things differently could have conserved her a lot of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then unfavorable pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>

Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, impacting your water quality.</p>
