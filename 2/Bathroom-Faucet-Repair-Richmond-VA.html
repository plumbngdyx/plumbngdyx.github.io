Do not create a connection in between an auxiliary water supply (well, cistern, body of water) and the water system plumbing. Be sure to call 811 prior to digging if you are digging a hole on your property. This service will notify you where gas lines are located, enabling you to avoid hitting them as you dig. Low risks: Seattle Public Utilities accepts double check valve assemblies, pressure vacuum breaker assemblies and climatic vacuum breakers as types of protection for low hazards. Examples of low threats are fire systems and watering systems.</p>

<p>A simple repair or changing specific parts may be all that's required to get your water heater working again if you have a newer unit. You might be tempted to weld or patch a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to save cash. While this might operate in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the exact same product as other pipes in your house, suggesting that difficulty could be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you peace of mind and prevent bigger leaks down the roadway.</p>
