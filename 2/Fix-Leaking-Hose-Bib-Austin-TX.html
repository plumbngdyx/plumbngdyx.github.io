<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a decline in provided pressure to the water circulation. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is usually localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to escape. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
