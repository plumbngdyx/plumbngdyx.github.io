<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on lorry traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to get away. Often no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose shut down lead to a significant pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>

Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
