<p>When it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your house, this is one of the very first and main concerns that you need to ask yourself. The age of your house is a vital component to comprehend whether or not you should repipe your house.

<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high threat" facilities.</p>
