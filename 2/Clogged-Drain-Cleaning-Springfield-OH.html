I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to examine.
