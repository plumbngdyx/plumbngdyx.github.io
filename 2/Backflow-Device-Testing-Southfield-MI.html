<p>Clearing of blockages, or the repair of leakages in soil, waste, or vent pipes, valves, components, or replacement of exposed traps in existing plumbing systems serving bathrooms, sinks, laundry trays or similar components. Leakages - If you see puddles on the floor, near the toilet, or water discolorations on the ceiling under the toilet, the wax ring needs to be replaced. If it ends up being hard to turn; it's likely you have actually experienced a clog, turn the handle counterclockwise. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of particles. Place it back into the drain till you strike resistance again, then turn the handle backward and forward to work some of the clog totally free. Pull the auger out occasionally to eliminate particles up until it moves past the blockage without resistance.</p>
