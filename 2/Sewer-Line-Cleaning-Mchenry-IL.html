Call 404-524-1825 for experienced Atlanta, GA repiping services. Backflow takes place anytime water streams through a pipes in the opposite instructions that it's indicated to. Backflow is an issue since it can trigger wastewater to recede into a home, contaminating the drinking water. Cover the flapper valve with your hand. Turn on the water (meticulously, so you do not get a cold shower!) and let it flush out the toilet valve for a couple of seconds.</p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
