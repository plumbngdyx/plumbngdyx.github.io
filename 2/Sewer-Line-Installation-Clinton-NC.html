The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water system motion. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to get away. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
