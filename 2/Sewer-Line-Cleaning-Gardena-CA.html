<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Gardena CA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system should be continuously kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
