<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become complete of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly regrowed.

The softener system then provides soft water for your use. Hard water triggers gray or white deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be used to lower these signs.</p>
