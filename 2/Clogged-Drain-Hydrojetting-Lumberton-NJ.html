Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water in fact requires it.

These more recent systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they conserve energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
