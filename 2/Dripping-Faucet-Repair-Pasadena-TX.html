<p>Your sewer line problem can lead to sewer backups, and they typically happen in the most affordable open drain. This type of problem is typically the outcome of a blockage in the line. If you do not detect the odor originating from the sewer backup, you might determine this issue due to the fact that a backup happens whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink.
