This has at times led to people believing that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there might never truly have been a concern in the very first location. This thinking can be both counterproductive and dangerous. Backflow events in water supply are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or absolutely nothing method to backflow security. We need to take a look at each installation for the danger it presents and after that install the correct protection.</p>
<p>A decrease in supply side pressure triggered by an incident such as a water main break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve enables the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
