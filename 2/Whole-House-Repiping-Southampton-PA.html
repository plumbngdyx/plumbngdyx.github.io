<h3>Drainage Pipe in Southampton Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Some producers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
