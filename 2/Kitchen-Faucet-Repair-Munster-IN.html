This will help you prevent unneeded services such as high-pressure sewer jets. These are terrific at getting rid of grease buildups or sand in the line, but frequently fraudsters firmly insist they're needed and push them with an expensive cost. Generally an excellent snaking with an electric rotating cable television will do the job simply as well.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). Check the directions if your valve is a different design from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems use UV light to destroy micro-organisms and provide purified water. The energy source required to heat up the water is more economical. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water firmness can be eliminated relatively easily by using an ion exchange treatment. Basic water softeners are cation exchange gadgets. Cations describe positively charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
