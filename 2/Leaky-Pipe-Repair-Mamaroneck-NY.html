<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Mamaroneck NY</h3>
<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, shower, or sink) can be fixed quickly if the clog is easy and shallow. For the majority of blockages you'll just need a plunger, and often some chemicals, however if this doesn't solve the issue then you might likewise need to hire a drain professional like Reckon & Reckon to assist. As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
