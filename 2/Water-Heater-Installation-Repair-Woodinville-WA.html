Water softeners generally have a life-span of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are properly maintained. Ensuring the brine tank never runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Safeguarding the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise protect the system. Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners enhance the regrowth cycle and aid alleviate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to turn off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve.

<p>Hard water, debris from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can prevent a flush valve from closing completely. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the debris. Photos 1 and 2 reveal you how to do this on one typical type of valve. Even though other valves will look different, the clearing procedure is similar. Nevertheless, you may have to get rid of a few screws on top of the fill valve to eliminate the cap.</p>
