<p>Gas water heaters are much easier to repair than electrical ones. A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP garbage disposal unit can grind soft, non-fibrous foods. There is very little insulation in the weaker designs. If you find a drip, plan to replace the hot water heater right now. Do not wait until the leak gets bad.

In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they ought to be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more serious is incorrect with them.</p>
