<p>Regrettably, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in locations where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green discolorations being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More expensive gas water heaters with unique venting systems likewise are offered. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
