<p>Throughout regular operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of minimized pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is created to discharge and open water to the outside if either check valve should leak.

For this factor, the RPZ must be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>
