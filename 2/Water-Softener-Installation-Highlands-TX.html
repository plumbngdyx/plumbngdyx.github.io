<p>Last but not least, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water streams at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline.

Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if pricey) device is best utilized in critical locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
