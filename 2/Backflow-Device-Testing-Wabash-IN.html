For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>

Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
