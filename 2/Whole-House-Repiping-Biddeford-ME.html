<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water created in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about totally restored.</p>
