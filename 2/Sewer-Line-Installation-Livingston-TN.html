<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Livingston TN</h3>

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
