<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. Many water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank.

Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
