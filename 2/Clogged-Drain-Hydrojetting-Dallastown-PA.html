I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
