<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 telltale signs of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect in time, they slowly begin to restrict the circulation of water, resulting in low water pressure.

<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Boaz AL</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. Since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to provide decades of defense. There are many local conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water temperature level, quality or turbidity can all cause the assembly to deteriorate in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies may rarely need repair while some are repaired regularly. The test information from the field test will figure out the repair frequency.</p>
