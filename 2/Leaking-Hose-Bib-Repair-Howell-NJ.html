It may not be installed in any place where it might ever be immersed under water. Some municipalities do not permit the use of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some don't allow the use of a PVB at all, so check with your water service provider. A PVB backflow preventer may spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow occurs, so it ought to be installed in a location where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>
<p>Repiping is carried out by experts who are specially trained and total most houses in 1-2 days. Throughout a repipe, not every room will be involved in the building and construction.
