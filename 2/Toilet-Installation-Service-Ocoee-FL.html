<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated annually. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an each year test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring before operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be checked each year to insure the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
