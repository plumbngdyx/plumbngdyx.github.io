The unit chosen for a provided installation should be proper for the system style and website conditions, including factor to consider of whether back siphoning or backpressure is likely to occur.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
