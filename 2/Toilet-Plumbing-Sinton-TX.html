Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and require less repairs in time.

<p>Obstructions are easily avoided with a few key actions. Location drain strainers on all drains, if possible. These strainers catch hair, food and other particles before it gets stuck, preventing the need of drain cleaning. Although they don't catch everything, it helps the system substantially. Installing a tankless hot water heater is a greater in advance investment, but these units can substantially cut the cost of regular monthly utilities.

Removing the backflow preventer to repair it is not required in most cases. Some parts such as relief valve bodies may need to be gotten rid of from the main body to help with a repair. Understanding the right order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
