It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational usage, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It likewise needs to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
