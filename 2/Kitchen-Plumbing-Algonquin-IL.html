A plumber is needed if this is the case. When many people think about plumbers, they generally call them for water pipe issues.

<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regenerated.</p>
