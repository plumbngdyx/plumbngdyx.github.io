<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system should be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>This ion exchange process is facilitated by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. This is another mix that can deal with sink blockages. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mixture sit for numerous hours, then flush with boiling water. If it does not work the very first time, you can duplicate this procedure.
