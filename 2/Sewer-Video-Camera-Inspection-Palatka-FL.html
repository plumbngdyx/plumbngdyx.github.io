If health or ecological factors demand restricting sodium, replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride may be suitable. In time, the beads end up being covered with minerals and have to be cleaned up. This cleaning process, called regrowth, has three cycles: backwash, rinse and recharge. The regrowth procedure can be arranged immediately with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
