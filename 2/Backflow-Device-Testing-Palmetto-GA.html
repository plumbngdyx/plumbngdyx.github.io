<p>There are 2 popular install systems utilized for garbage disposers: the standard 3-bolt mount (if you've had actually a disposer installed for a long time, it's most likely mounted this way) and a newer system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a similar system called "Quick Lock"). Each accomplish the exact same task with little distinction, aside from their installation. As the name suggests, the EZ Mount system is intended to be much easier to deal with when installing or repairing a system.</p>
<p>Water heater repair can often be cost-prohibitive. You'll pay for the required repairs only to face another problem soon afterwards. Constantly continue to run water during and after using your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has vanished down the drain. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
