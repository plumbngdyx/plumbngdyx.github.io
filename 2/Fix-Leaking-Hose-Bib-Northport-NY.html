The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to leave.
