Sometimes, low water pressure is also related to more severe problems with pipes that need to be dealt with before they worsen.</p>
<p>Lubrication may aid with the placement of some parts within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any much better, it is only there to help the service technician put together the components into the body without producing damage from friction. The lubricant must be a food grade lube to ensure the water supply is not contaminated. Oftentimes the very best lubricant is water. The normal usage for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be gently oiled to guarantee they do not present of their retainer. The use of excessive lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to stop working or wear out earlier by attracting dirt and particles or limiting the movement of the part. The proper quantity of lube need to make the surface of the 'ring appear wet. You should never ever see pieces or globs of lube.</p>

And if the house was built prior to World War II, then it almost certainly requires replacements for its old pipes, probably whole-house repiping.</p>
