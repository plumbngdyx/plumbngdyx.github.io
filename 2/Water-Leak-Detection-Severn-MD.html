Plumbing codes mandate that drinkable water products be secured against backflow at all cross-connections. We provide the largest selection of backflow prevention solutions for any application.</p>
<p>Those of us in the industry know that cross-connection programs in lots of areas have significantly lowered the number of reported events that happen within our water supply. This has at times led to people believing that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there may never truly have actually been an issue in the first place. This thinking can be both dangerous and detrimental. Backflow occurrences in water supply are an outcome of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far a lot of areas we have an all or nothing approach to backflow protection.
