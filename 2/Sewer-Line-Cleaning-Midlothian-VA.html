<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become complete of sodium ions from the water softener salt when freshly restored. As tough water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions.
