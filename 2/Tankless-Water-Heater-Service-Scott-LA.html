It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Sadly, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
