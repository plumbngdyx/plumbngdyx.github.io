To prep your unit for installation, you might have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug kit that I bought separately from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
