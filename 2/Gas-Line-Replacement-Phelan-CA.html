A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
