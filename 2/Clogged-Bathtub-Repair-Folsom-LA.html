<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential licenses provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated every year. Likewise allows provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be checked annually to insure the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
