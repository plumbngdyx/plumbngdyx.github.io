<p>The term hard water refers to water with a high mineral material. These minerals can vary depending on which area of the country you're in, however most commonly consist of calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates. Difficult water does not begin hard-- instead, it gets mineral deposits as it is available in contact with limestone underground. These mineral deposits stay when the water is routed into pipes for commercial and residential usage, unless the water is softened or filtered.</p>

<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is heated straight whenever it's needed. Tankless systems particularly use an element that heats up water when the tap is switched on. The water is continuously heated as long as the tap stays on. If the tap is immediately switched off, the water stops being heated. The heating temperature is normally pre-set to suit your requirements and preferences. Because they only heat water when needed, tankless electrical water heaters utilize less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
