In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly.
