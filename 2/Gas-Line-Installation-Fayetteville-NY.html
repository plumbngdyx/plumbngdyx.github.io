<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
