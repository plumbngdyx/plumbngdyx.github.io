Grains per gallon is specified as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolved in one US gallon (3.785 l) of water. Parts per million is specified as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. To transform in between gpg and ppm utilize the following element; 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm.
