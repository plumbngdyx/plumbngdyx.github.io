<p>To help prevent obstructions within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of utilize the method set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle efficiently halves the interior diameter of the tee. When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is specifically true. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
