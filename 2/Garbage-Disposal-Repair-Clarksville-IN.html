If pressing down on the flapper stops the sound, the flapper isn't sealing under regular pressure. Turn off the water, flush the toilet to clear the tank and after that run your finger around the rim of the flush valve seat.

Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions.

The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
