<h3>Water Heater Maintenance in Pottsville Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>The US Department of Energy states that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd highest energy consuming area of a home, beside heating and cooling.

<p>Polybutylene pipes were utilized in some houses around twenty to forty years back. These pipes very unreliable and prone to failure. The failure is an outcome of piping products and fittings breaking down, but is incorrectly attributed to poor workmanship in many cases. Some homeowners presume that because their piping has lasted some years without failure that it is not malfunctioning. In fact, most polybutylene pipes last for approximately twenty years before stopping working.</p>
<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
