These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically restore after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
