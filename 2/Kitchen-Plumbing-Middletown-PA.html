<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your house. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
