Rinckey said that a conservative estimate of 20 to 30 percent is how much longer an appliance's life expectancy is with the addition of a water softening system.

<p>During typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of minimized pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is designed to release and open water to the outside. An RPZ will occasionally release percentages of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>

<p>A freshly installed hot water heater need to not produce odd sounds, but it will start to create rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder with time as the heater goes to heat the water. Things get worse drastically for families with a high demand for warm water. The factors for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be required.</p>

The assembly consists of resilient, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>
