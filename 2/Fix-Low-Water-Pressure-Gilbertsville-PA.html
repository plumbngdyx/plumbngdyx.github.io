Softening your thin down to the optimal level of 6 grains of solidity is ideal for household use because the water stays less corrosive than over-softened water and is free of scale producing solidity. Unbreakable Clogs: Professional support is the best solution, if you find yourself provided with a particularly stubborn clog.
