Pressure vacuum breakers utilize a check valve created to close with the help of a spring when water circulation stops. Its air-inlet valve opens when the internal pressure is one psi above atmospheric pressure, preventing non-potable water from being siphoned back into the safe and clean system. The assembly includes resistant, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>
