There are a variety of ways property owners can unclog a kitchen sink, including using a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or using a solution of vinegar and baking soda. For the more extreme clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>

You need to always run cold water into the waste disposal unit while crushing foods. Cold water strengthens greases that have actually been disposed of.

Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and need less repairs over time.
