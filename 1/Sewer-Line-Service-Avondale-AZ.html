Professional sewer and drain companies like Roto-Rooter are able to remotely line the section of the pipe that is broken without needing to dig a trench. After the interior of the pipe is cleaned up and dried, the installers will apply the lining to the issue area. The liner is treated in place with jets of hot steam as it molds into all the fractures inside the pipe.</p>
