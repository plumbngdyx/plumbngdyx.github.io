<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
