Although your waste disposal unit frequently goes undetected in your kitchen it can truly cause problems when it stops functioning or gets clogged. Check to make sure it's not your garbage disposal that's triggering the issue. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then examine it to make sure it's running correctly. If the disposal has overheated, you might need to turn the switch found on the side or bottom of the unit below the sink.</p>

<p>Run the hot water. Hot water is your good friend, especially for your kitchen sink.

Running the hot water after you have actually utilized your sink assists clear debris and break up food and oils and keep your drain clear. Channeling occurs when the incoming hard water follows a narrow path through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened. If you've ever seen that the busier your company is, the better your cleaning agent works, the offender could be an extra-large softener.</p>

Bacteria and fungis: If your supply of water is not disinfected prior to softening, germs and fungi can possibly grow on the surface. This can reduce the effectiveness of your softener.</p>
