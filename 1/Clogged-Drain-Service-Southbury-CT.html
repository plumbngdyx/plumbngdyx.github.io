<p>Your sewer line problem can result in sewer backups, and they typically happen in the lowest open drain. This kind of issue is typically the outcome of a clog in the line. If you do not detect the smell originating from the sewer backup, you may determine this problem due to the fact that a backup happens whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your home is dependent upon the main sewer line for correct drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's a separated concern with only that drain, which is not most likely to be a sewage issue.</p>
