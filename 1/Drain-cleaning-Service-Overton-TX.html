For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to harden and split or just be so squished that it does not fill the area in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become so worn or rusty that they spring a leak.
