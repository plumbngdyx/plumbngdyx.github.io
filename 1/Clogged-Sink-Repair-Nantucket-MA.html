Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water delivered to our customers is kept free from damaging contaminants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices including a nonpotable substance, this is known as a cross-connection.

<p>According to the Contractors State License Board, It will be considered un-lawful to install any water heating device without an inspection by the local authorities". Huge Blue Plumbing can acquire and manage the permit procedure. Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, use or tiredness. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be tested regularly to ensure they are working effectively. A visual check of air gaps is sufficient, however mechanical backflow preventers have to be tested with properly adjusted gauge devices.</p>
