The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high threat" facilities.</p>
