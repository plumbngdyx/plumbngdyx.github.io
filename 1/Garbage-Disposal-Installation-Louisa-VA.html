<p>This 3-stage water treatment system with a stainless steel filter media tank will filter and soften your water for many years to come. Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows happen from them, these water functions are considered a health threat. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area must be shown on building and construction strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond need to be tested upon installation and after that every year.</p>
<p>When you turn your irrigation system on, it's an excellent concept to check your backflow assembly every spring. However, we seldom suggest CPVC when a whole home needs repiping.

Contact your state's licensing board for more details.</p>
