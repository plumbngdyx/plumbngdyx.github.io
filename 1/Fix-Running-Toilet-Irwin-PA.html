Subsequently residential licenses provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be tested each year. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an each year test.
