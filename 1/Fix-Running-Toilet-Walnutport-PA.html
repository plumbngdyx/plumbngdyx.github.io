<p>A PVB should be installed 12 inches above the greatest emission point. The benefit of this device is that you can install multiple zone valves in valve boxes underground after the device. Nevertheless, if there are numerous leaks within the system, or if there is proof of corrosion in a number of locations, it is most likely time to repipe. Seriousness of repair- Depending on the seriousness of the damage (and how many pieces need to be repaired or changed), it may be more cost effective to replace your toilet altogether.</p>
