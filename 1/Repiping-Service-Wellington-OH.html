<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>
