<h3>Residential 24 Hour Emergency Plumber Near Me Abingdon VA</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
