Today, a lot of quality contractors utilize PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that should also be well preserved to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and split or simply be so squished that it does not fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain whatever remains in great shape.</p>
