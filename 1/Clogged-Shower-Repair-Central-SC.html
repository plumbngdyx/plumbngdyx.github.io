<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (generally salt or often potassium).</p>

<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads end up being loaded with salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. Hard water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be utilized to lower these signs.</p>
