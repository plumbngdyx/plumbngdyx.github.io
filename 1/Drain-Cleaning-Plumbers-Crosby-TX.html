<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water travels through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is generally utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
