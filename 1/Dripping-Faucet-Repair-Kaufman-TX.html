<p>Main sewer repair includes substantial excavation, fortifying supporting walls, communicating and eliminating pipe and connections, backfilling, and installing plates for temporary cover. Service lines which originate from private property and feed into the main line are a normal area for breaks or leaks. Off-road tasks outside the right-of-way need a great deal of manual labor for excavation and transporting materials, rock, and dirt to and from the site.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close.
