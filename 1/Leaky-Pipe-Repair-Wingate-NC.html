<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than utilize the method laid out above. Due to the fact that the baffle successfully halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially true when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
