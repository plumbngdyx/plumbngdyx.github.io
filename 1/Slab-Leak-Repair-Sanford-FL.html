With a hot water heater replacement, you'll fix your repair issues, and have enhanced hot water heater performance also. The salt uptake through softened water depends upon the firmness of the water. Averagely, less than 3% salt uptake comes from consuming softened water. Clark's Process: This procedure is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which triggers the hardness ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 need to be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.</p>

<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent to drain. This process continues until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered fully restored.</p>
