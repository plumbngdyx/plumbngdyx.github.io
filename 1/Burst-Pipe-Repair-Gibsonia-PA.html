<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt when freshly restored. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. Difficult water causes white or gray deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be used to reduce these symptoms.</p>
