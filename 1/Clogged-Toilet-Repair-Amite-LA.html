<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service in Amite LA?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be continually kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
