<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
