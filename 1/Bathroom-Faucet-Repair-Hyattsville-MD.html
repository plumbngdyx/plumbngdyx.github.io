<p>A decrease in supply side pressure caused by an occurrence such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire fighting, causes the supply pressure to drop below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve enables the excess customer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release up until the supply side pressure once again surpasses the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
