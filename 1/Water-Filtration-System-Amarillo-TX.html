<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you are going to remodel it is a good time to repipe before you paint or finish your walls.  It is important to comprehend the scope of the project prior to work is started. If you observe an isolated leak or a little portion of your existing piping leaking, or valves that are rusted or split, it is rather perhaps a sign of a larger issue.</p>
