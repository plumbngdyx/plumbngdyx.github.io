<p>Backflow prevention devices are developed to safeguard the general public water supply from cross-connections. A modern-day neighborhood water system system is designed to ensure that water streams to residential or commercial properties and structures under pressure.

A cross-connection can take place where there is a pressure drop in the water pipe. This pressure drop triggers a vacuum and siphons of entrainment water from end-users into the public supply of water.</p>

Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to get away.
