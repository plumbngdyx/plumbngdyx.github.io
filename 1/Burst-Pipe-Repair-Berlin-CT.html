As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many desired usages around your home.</p>
