<h3>How to Save Water With Leak Detection Awareness in Lakeside CA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system must be continually kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
