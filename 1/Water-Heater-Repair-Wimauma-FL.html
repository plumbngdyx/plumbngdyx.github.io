<p>The most efficient method to resolve tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
