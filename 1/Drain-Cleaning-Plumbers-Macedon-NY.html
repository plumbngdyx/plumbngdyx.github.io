<p>Salt-free systems will also decrease scale buildup and supply brighter clothes and softer skin utilizing a much healthier approach. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without having to add sodium to the water. This is a more heart ecologically friendly and healthy system. Traditional salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have an unfavorable impact on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high sodium material in the waste water. Salt-free systems are maintenance totally free and utilize no waste water, no salt and no electricity or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are exceptionally low maintenance since the media can last approximately five years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be replenished on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
