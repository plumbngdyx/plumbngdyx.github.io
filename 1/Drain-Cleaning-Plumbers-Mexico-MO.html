<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
