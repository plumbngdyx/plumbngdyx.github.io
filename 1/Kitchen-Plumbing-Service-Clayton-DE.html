<p>A clogged toilet is one of the most common bathroom plumbing problems.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a risk to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
<p>During the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent to drain. This process continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about completely regrowed.</p>
