<p>Our group at All Stage Plumbing also utilizes drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also referred to as trenchless pipe lining is a excellent and durable  alternative for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining process involves our team saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. When the felt liner is entirely saturated, it is pushed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all fractures and imperfections. The liner is left to solidify in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes if heat is utilized. As soon as the procedure is total, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be examined one more time to make certain your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>

Licensing generally needs an examination or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board for more details.</p>
<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Considering that I love to prepare, I generate a great deal of dishes. We set up a short-term workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, but after a day of this we recognized that we required the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the home within 30 minutes and he guarantees that the sink will remain clog-free for thirty days. If it clogs again within that time, he will come out and fix it free of charge - that is what I call service!  We are extremely delighted that we picked Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely utilize this company once again and again in the future.</p>
