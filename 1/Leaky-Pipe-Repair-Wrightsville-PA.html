<p>Backflow prevention devices are designed to secure the public water supply from cross-connections. A contemporary neighborhood supply of water system is developed to make sure that water streams to properties and buildings under pressure. This community water network consists of lots of users where there is a threat to public health if there is a cross-connection between the water supply and a contaminated source.
