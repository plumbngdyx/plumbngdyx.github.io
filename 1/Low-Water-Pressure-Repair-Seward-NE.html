Consequently residential authorizations provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated annually. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to operating the watering system.
