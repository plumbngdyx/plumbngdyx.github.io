<p>As water heaters age, specifically when they approach the years mark, you might start to see some issues. Any types of weird sounds usually suggest difficulty. Popping sounds, for instance, indicate that the water is boiling (which need to never ever occur). Sediment accumulation or a malfunctioning thermostat represent typical factors for boiling water.

PEX is easy to install, which implies the cost of installation might be low too. There is some threat of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is uncommon. In general, it's a cost-effective solution that will stand the test of time. We often recommend this product, though it will depend.</p>
