<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily stored for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
