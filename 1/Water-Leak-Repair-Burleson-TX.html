<p>Salt-free systems will likewise decrease scale accumulation and supply brighter clothing and softer skin utilizing a much healthier technique. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without needing to add sodium to the water. This is a more heart healthy and environmentally friendly system. Conventional salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have an unfavorable result on people with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high sodium content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and utilize no waste water, no electrical power and no salt or chemicals.

Salt-based systems require the salt to be replenished on a regular monthly basis.</p>
