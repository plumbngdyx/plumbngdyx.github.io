<p>Leakages are tricky. While the time needed will vary based on your house size and the number of found breakdowns, it's best to reserve approximately 2 hours when you set up an inspection. There's always the chance that your plumber's previous job will run long and delay the starting time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next visit, they likely rushed the task (unless you have an extremely little plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection generally takes when you call to arrange your visit.</p>

PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are exceptional options to the costly copper piping.</p>
