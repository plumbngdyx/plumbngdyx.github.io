For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to harden and crack or merely be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything is in tip-top shape.</p>
