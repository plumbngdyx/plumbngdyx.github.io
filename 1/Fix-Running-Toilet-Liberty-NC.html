<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners.

<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to service? The timing of regeneration depends upon the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water really needs it.

These newer systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect since they conserve energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
