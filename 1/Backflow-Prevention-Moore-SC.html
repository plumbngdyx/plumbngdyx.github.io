<p>Sodium intake from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or environmental factors require restricting sodium, substituting potassium chloride for salt chloride might be suitable. Over time, the beads end up being coated with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning process, called regrowth, has three cycles: recharge, backwash and rinse. The regrowth procedure can be arranged immediately with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
