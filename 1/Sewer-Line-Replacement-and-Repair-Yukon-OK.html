<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>You'll want to keep a look for leakages too, obviously. Even small ones that are quickly fixed may be indicators that the time for whole-house replacement is approaching. After all, the original pipes in your house are the same vintage, they're made from the same material, and they have actually gone through the same water system and use patterns.

Several repairs are costly, however they also point to stopping working components within your toilet. Save yourself the headache and replace a toilet that requires many repairs before it breaks down totally.</p>

<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has already been fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Again, it is suggested to inspect the producer's guidelines for special precautions.</p>
