<p>Those of us in the market know that cross-connection programs in many areas have vastly reduced the number of reported incidents that take place within our water systems. This has at times led to people thinking that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there might never actually have been a concern in the first place. This thinking can be both detrimental and hazardous. Backflow events in water supply are an outcome of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a decreased pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or nothing method to backflow security. We need to take a look at each installation for the hazard it provides and after that install the correct protection.</p>

This place frequently experiences leaks too. This might be due to a backup of clogged sewage that cant get to the main sewer lines.</p>
