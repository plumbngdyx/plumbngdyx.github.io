These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally restore after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>
