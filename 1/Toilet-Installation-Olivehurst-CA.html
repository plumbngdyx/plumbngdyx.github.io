Watering backflow prevention assemblies must be evaluated by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to guarantee correct backflow prevention is in place to protect our drinking water during the irrigation season. Denver Water will send out a testing suggestion notification 1 month prior to the annual test is due.

While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment.

That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Climatic vacuum breaker. Although you might have a number of atmospheric vacuum breakers on your system, the water will only stream through among them on its way to the sprinklers or emitters. Therefore, you just consist of the pressure loss for one vacuum breaker in your calculation. Many makers don't have pressure loss information for vacuum breakers, so presume a pressure loss of 2 PSI for a vacuum breaker if no producer's literature is offered.</p>
