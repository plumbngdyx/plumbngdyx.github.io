In time sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder performance, and draining pipes a gallon or so helps get rid of the sediment.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
