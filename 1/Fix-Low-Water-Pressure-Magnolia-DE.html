<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the simplest of the 3 offered approaches. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This process includes finishing Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to avoid leaks and deterioration within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier between the inside of the pipe and the material streaming through it. This repair technique is preferable for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals. The service technician, Kenny, was respectful, useful and professional! He asked me to take a look at the camera with him then discussed my options without attempting to oversell me! I would extremely advise the Clog Dawg for an as soon as or yearly inspection if you suspect that roots might be causing havoc in your drainage pipes.</p>
