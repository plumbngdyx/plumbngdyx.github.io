Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a few things differently could have saved her a lot of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure.

That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater.
