<p>Installation and replacement expenses are frequently equivalent, though replacement normally will not require surcharges, such as application fees. New meters must satisfy guidelines and code requirements for their positioning, and gas companies might require an unique meter for their services, restricting your options. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the office number listed on the building license. Inspections need to be made after structure excavation (prior to pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon completion. KEEP IN MIND: If defective work is discovered, the inspector will provide an offense notice, and a particular period of time is allotted to remedy the issue.</p>
