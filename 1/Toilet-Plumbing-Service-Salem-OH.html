Running the hot water after you've utilized your sink helps clear debris and separate food and oils and keep your drain clear. Carrying happens when the incoming hard water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened. If you've ever noticed that the busier your business is, the better your detergent works, the culprit could be a large softener.</p>
