<p>Our group at All Stage Plumbing likewise uses drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also called trenchless pipe lining is a excellent and resilient  choice for your broken pipes. The pipe lining process includes our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is completely saturated, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all cracks and flaws. If heat is used, the liner is left to solidify in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes. When the procedure is complete, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be examined one more time to make certain your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
