<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
