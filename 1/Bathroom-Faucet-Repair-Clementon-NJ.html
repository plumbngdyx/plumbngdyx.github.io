<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) needs plumbing contractors to obtain a plumbing permit before replacing a backflow or installing preventer. Your water heater. The pro will next examine your water heater. With your hot water heater, he or she is looking at water temperature, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless hot water heater ). Some will likewise flush your water heater at this time, which is an annual maintenance job that prevents hard water and sediment accumulation. To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to wash out any buildup.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. A lot of water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank renewed.</p>
