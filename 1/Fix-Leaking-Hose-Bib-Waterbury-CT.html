Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe in addition to the rest of your wastewater.</p>

Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water delivered to our clients is kept devoid of harmful pollutants.
