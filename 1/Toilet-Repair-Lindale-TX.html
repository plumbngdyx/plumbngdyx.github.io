<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
