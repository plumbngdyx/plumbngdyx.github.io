Well, first let's ask you a different question: How old is your house? If it was constructed prior to 1970, it may have pipes made from an out-of-date product that will begin to offer you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they have not already).

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models.
