Typically, the very first two numbers suggest the year of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to damage micro-organisms and supply cleansed water. The energy source required to heat the water is less costly.

Cations describe positively charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
