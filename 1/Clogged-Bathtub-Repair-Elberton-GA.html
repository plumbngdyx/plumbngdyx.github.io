<p>Standpipe systems are utilized in numerous centers, these systems are created to provide water to fire hose connections or hose cabinets tactically installed inside a building. These systems normally are installed in large, open spaces within buildings, and in multistory structures for the function of manual firefighting. Standpipe systems can provide early fire suppression in these buildings making it capable for a single individual or firefighter to offer a effective and quick action to fire. There are 2 kinds of standpipe systems, the very first type, are dry systems, which generally contain no long-term water system and are pressurized through a fire department connection by fire workers reacting to an event. A dry standpipe system requires no backflow prevention defense. The 2nd type is a damp standpipe system which is typically linked to the buildings potable water system and needs the installation of a double check valve assembly.</p>
<p>More complicated is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has actually found extensive usage since it prevents both siphonage and back pressure.

Each spring-loaded check valve is set to allow water at anticipated operational pressure to stream through. Must backflow happen, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs knock the valves shut tight, avoiding the entrance of cross contamination water.</p>
