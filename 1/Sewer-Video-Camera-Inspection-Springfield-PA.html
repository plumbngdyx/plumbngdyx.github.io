They significantly minimize your water heating costs because there is no tank" of water for the system to continually heat and re-heat all day long. Instead, water is just warmed when you actually turn on a hot water fixture.

More recent systems use computerized sensors that keep track of bead exhaustion and other crucial metrics based upon your water usage and therefore just regrow when required. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect because they save energy and money-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
