<p>Our process begins with an inspection of the different problems faced by the property owner, this is followed by one of our extensive group of service technicians inserting a camera into the drains to determine the blocked area and figure out how best to proceed. In the past, a blocked drain indicated a snake would be utilized to pierce a hole in the drain to allow a percentage of wastewater to travel through the obstruction and keep the waste moving through the drain.</p>
<p>We had a terrific experience. Kevin and Tim were our service technicians and both were excellent. They got here on time, were very considerate and professional. The quote was reasonable and they salvaged whatever they could to keep our expenses down. Will be using them once again in the future.
