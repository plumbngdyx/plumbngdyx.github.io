<p>Leaks are sneaky. While the time needed will vary based upon the house size and the variety of discovered malfunctions, it's best to set aside up to 2 hours when you set up an inspection.

If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely hurried the job (unless you have a very small plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection usually takes when you call to schedule your consultation.</p>
