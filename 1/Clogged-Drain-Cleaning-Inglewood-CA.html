<p>An rdc is similar to a DC because it is a mechanical backflow preventer consisting of 2 independently acting, spring-loaded check valves. Nevertheless, it generally does not consist of shutoff valves, might or might not be equipped with test cocks or ports, and is typically less reliable than a DC. An rdc is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but must be utilized to isolate just nonhealth hazards and is meant for use only in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the issue if this is the case. You might need to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
