<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Often a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
