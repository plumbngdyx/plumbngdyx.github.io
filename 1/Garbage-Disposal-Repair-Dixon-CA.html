<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
