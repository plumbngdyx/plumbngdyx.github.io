A drain specialist like TLC will use a camera to check your drain system. Typically, if you have multiple drain problems you may have a drain line break somewhere in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can find and determine the issue so the drain can be repaired.</p>

Nevertheless, there are particular circumstances when a cleaning may not be enough to get your drains back up and running appropriately. In those circumstances, a repair could be required as the drains have some amount of damage that may need a bit more work.
