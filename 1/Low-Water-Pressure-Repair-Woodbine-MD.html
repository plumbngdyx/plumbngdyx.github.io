<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman believed the rate she spent for a plumber to replace her garbage disposal was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things in a different way might have saved her a lot of money. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then unfavorable or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common.

Get rid of the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
