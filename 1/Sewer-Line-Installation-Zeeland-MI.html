<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Zeeland MI</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system should be continuously kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
