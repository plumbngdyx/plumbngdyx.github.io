<p>Natural Gas and propane that comes out of the ground is completely odor free. The egg odor connected with natural gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety preventative measures you must require to protect yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions also allow options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.
