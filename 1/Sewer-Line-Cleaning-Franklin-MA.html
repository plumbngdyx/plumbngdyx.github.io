<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product. A waste disposal unit solves all of those problems, adding benefit. Simply turn on water at the sink and the garbage disposal does the rest - and much more silently than you think. By pulverizing food waste-- modern garbage disposals do not actually utilize blades - it's processed by water treatment centers where the small particulates are quickly strained and became solid fertilizer, which, in turn, can be offered to lower the overall costs of treatment.</p>

This procedure needs to be done by licensed plumbers because it can be hazardous if done by someone without any training or experience.</p>
