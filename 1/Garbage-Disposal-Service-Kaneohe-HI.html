<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Lowering or getting rid of water firmness is done with a tool referred to as a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange process happens. A softener is comprised of various components, each having their own unique function. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel usually constructed out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener lie in the control valve or softener head as it is commonly referred to. Most popular water softeners have an automatic regenerating system.  The most standard type has an electrical timer that flushes and charges the system on a regular schedule.</p>
