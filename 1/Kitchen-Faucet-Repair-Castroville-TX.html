<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Castroville TX?</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange install) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the install ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
