<p>She learnt about the service call fee. The 4 In Your Corner Investigation discovered that's a common fee. Consumer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get an estimate from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of business we called would provide an estimate over the phone. All of them wished to look at the circumstance prior to committing to a price, and all wanted to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
