<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
