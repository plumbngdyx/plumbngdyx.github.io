Assess the sewer lines from residential or commercial property to suppress connection, septic tank, and drainage systems to thoroughly check if pipe damage, rust, or significant obstructions are present. Tree roots are among the biggest reasons for a sewer line backup. As roots get into the drain line they can trigger obstructions and back up into your home.</p>

If you smell gas, do not try to locate the leak. Rather, leave your home or structure right away. Do not turn on or off any electrical switches, home appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge might develop a trigger. When you remain in a safe place, call the Peoples emergency hotline.</p>
