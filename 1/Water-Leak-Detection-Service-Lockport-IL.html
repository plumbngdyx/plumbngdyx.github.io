<p>Re-piping is a process of replacing the supply pipes in a home or business. It is not a momentary fix or a replacement of short sections of pipe, but a total replacement of your supply plumbing system. There are several reasons you may need to repipe your home or service. Corrosion of pipes may cause low water pressure, rusty colored water, reduced water circulation, or leaks. If you are going to renovate it is a good time to repipe before you paint or complete your walls.  It is important to understand the scope of the project before work is begun. If you observe an isolated leak or a little part of your existing piping leaking, or valves that are worn away or split, it is quite potentially a sign of a bigger problem.</p>
