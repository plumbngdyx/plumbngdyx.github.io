If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall.
