<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily kept for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
