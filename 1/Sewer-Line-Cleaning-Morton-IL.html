The cost to top a gas line is covered by a plumbers callout charge of $75 to $150 and takes thirty minutes. For multiple gas lines that need topping, expect to spend $25 to $85 per cap. When switching to electrical or removing a home appliance, capping a gas line prevents leaks.</p>
<p>Your first step is to shut off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home.
