<p>Sediment Build-Up: If you notice weird popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your system, this might be an indicator that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element. Lacking warm water rapidly is another sign of sediment build-up, due to the fact that the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat.
