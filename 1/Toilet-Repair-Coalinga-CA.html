The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
<p>3. Banging or snapping sounds - Over adequate time, there might be significant sediment built-up in your hot water heater that can create this snapping or popping sound that can be pretty loud.
