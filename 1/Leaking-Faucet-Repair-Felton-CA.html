Basements and energy rooms include a few of a home's crucial and regularly used residential plumbing fixtures. Roto-Rooter's specialist plumbers offer a full series of basement plumbing services and drain cleaning services, however basement floor drain cleaning is one of the most common. To prep your unit for installation, you may need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug set that I purchased independently from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water passes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This process continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered totally restored.</p>
