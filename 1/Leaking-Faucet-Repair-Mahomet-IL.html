While it's not likely that having a disposal launch while your head is pressed versus it will result in decapitation, it may frighten a number of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience. When to repair: Under no scenarios should your toilet relocation when you sit or press on it. If your toilet relocations, get in touch with a plumber The toilet may not have been set up correctly, in which case the plumber might need to tighten its bolts or replace the wax seal around its base.
