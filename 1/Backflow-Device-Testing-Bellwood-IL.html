The beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly regenerated. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. When water is heated up, tough water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these signs.</p>
