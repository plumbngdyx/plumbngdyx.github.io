<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
