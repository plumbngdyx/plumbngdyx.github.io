Before we ever start the repiping process, we will explain the materials to be utilized, the work that will be performed, and the costs of the process. We will also discuss to you any work that we will contract out to a contractor who will refinish your walls.</p>
<p>If you home uses a septic system and drain field, you'll need a special garbage disposal.
