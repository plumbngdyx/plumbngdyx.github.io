<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
