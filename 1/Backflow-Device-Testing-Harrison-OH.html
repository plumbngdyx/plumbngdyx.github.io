Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is just recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, typically restore after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are hassle-free if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
