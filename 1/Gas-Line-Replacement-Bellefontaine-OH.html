<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Bellefontaine OH</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
