<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily kept for later use when need rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
