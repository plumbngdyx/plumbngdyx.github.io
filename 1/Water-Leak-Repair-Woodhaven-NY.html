Plumbing water lines ought to not be installed in unconditioned areas unless the local climate appropriates.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>

It may not be set up in any place where it might ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not permit the usage of PVBs with drip irrigation systems.
