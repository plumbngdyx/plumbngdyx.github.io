<p>Run the hot water. Warm water is your pal, particularly for your kitchen sink. Even if you are really cautious with what you put down your sinks, food remnants and cooking oils still get away down our drains - particularly the kitchen sink. Running the hot water after you've utilized your sink assists clear debris and break up food and oils and keep your drain clear. Funneling happens when the inbound tough water follows a narrow path through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a danger to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
