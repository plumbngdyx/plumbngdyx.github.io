Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, no matter whether the water in fact requires it.

These newer systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
