Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- usually sodium. The result is water that's been effectively softened by removing almost all traces of the minerals that make up difficult water.</p>
