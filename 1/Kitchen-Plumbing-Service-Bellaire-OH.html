<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
