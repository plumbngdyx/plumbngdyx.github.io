<p>To help prevent blockages within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the approach set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior size of the tee. When the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is specifically true. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
