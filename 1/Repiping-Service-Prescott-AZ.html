As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its numerous designated uses around your house.</p>
