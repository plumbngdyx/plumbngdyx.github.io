<p>To assist prevent blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the technique set out above. Because the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is particularly real when the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
<h3>Clogged Drain in Phillipsburg New Jersey</h2>

In basic, it's an economical option that will stand the test of time. We typically recommend this material, though it will depend.</p>
