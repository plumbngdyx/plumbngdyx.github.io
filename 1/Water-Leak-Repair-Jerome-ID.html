<p>A PVB should be set up 12 inches above the greatest emission point. The advantage of this device is that you can install numerous zone valves in valve boxes underground after the device. However, if there are numerous leakages within the system, or if there is evidence of corrosion in numerous places, it is probably time to repipe. Intensity of repair- Depending upon the seriousness of the damage (and the number of pieces need to be repaired or replaced), it may be more cost effective to replace your toilet entirely.</p>
<p>A few local authorities require that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't use a PVB unless the water source is at the high-end of the irrigated area. It may not be set up in any location where it might ever be immersed under water. Some towns do not allow the use of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some don't enable the use of a PVB at all, so check with your water service provider. A PVB backflow preventer might spit or spill water out of under the cap when backflow takes place, so it ought to be set up in a location where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
