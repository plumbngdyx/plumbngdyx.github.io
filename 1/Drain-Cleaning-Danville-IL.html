<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated directly whenever it's required. Tankless systems specifically use an element that warms up water when the tap is turned on. The water is constantly heated as long as the tap stays on. The water stops being heated up if the tap is instantly changed off. The heating temperature is generally pre-set to fit your requirements and preferences. Because they just heat water when required, tankless electrical water heaters utilize less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
