<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two indicators of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up in time, they slowly begin to restrict the circulation of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you discover it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, affecting your water quality.</p>
