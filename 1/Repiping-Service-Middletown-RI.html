<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home.

Set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different design from the one we reveal, inspect the directions. After mounting the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
