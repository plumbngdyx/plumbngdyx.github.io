<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Salem MA</h3>
<p>Close all exterior doors and windows and turn on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a nearby hot water faucet up until you hear the gas burner in the water heater fire up. After a minute, move a cigarette smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Picture 7) on top of the heater. The smoke should be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke does not draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Switch off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to fix the problem.</p>
