<p>Even if all seems well with your hot water heater, it's a good idea to schedule water heater service from time to time simply to ensure that whatever is kosher. Sediment accumulation is a typical problem with hot water heater New Orleans, especially in older units. In time, calcium, magnesium, and limescale can gather on the sides of the tank and around the burner.

Water heater filtration can flush out these minerals and avoid a breakdown. The burner must also be checked occasionally to ensure that the flame is blue with a yellow pointer. If the flame is yellow-orange, it will affect your water heater's efficiency, and it might release carbon monoxide gas fumes into your indoor air.</p>
