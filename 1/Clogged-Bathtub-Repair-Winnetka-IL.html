<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
