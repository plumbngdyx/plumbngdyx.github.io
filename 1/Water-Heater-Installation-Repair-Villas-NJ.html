With a water heater replacement, you'll fix your repair issues, and have improved water heater efficiency as well. The salt uptake through softened water depends on the firmness of the water. Averagely, less than 3% salt uptake originates from consuming softened water. Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a complete repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
