<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The simplest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is needed to conquer the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its style and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it might be impractical in many circumstances to install a pipe segment of this length. Furthermore, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
