<p>Salt-free systems will likewise reduce scale accumulation and supply brighter clothes and softer skin using a healthier approach. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without needing to add salt to the water. This is a more heart ecologically friendly and healthy system. Standard salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have a negative impact on people with high-blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Some cities are beginning to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high sodium content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and use no drainage, no electricity and no salt or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are extremely low maintenance because the media can last as much as 5 years without replacing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be renewed on a month-to-month basis.</p>
