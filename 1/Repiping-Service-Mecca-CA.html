The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water supply motion. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to get away.
