<p>Decreasing or removing water hardness is made with a piece of equipment called a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange process happens. A softener is consisted of various components, each having their own special purpose. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel usually constructed out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener lie in the control valve or softener head as it is commonly referred to. Most popular water softeners have an automated regenerating system.  The most basic type has an electrical timer that charges the system and flushes on a regular schedule.</p>

I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
