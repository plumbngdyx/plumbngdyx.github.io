<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close.
