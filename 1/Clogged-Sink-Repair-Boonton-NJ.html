While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
