<p>Backflow prevention devices are designed to safeguard the general public water supply from cross-connections. A modern neighborhood water system system is developed to guarantee that water flows to properties and structures under pressure. If there is a cross-connection between the water supply and a polluted source, this neighborhood water network contains numerous users where there is a risk to public health. A cross-connection can occur where there is a pressure drop in the water main. This pressure drop causes a vacuum and siphons of entrainment water from end-users into the public water supply.</p>
<p>SofTap's water softening technology is well-suited for household, commercial, and commercial applications, including the prevention of limescale accumulation in households and scaling in industrial water treatment systems, along with improving present reverse osmosis treatment systems. The technology is easier and more cost-effective than other softening systems on the marketplace today that use zeolites, which need to be restored using brine, or membrane nanofiltration that needs considerable water use and high pressure.</p>
