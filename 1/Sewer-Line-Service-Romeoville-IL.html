<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
