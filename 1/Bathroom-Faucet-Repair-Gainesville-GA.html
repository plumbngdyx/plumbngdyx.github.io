I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial clog, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
