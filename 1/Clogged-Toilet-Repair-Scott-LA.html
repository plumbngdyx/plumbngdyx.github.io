While there's not a specific schedule as to when you should repipe your house, you need to certainly look into repiping if they have not been done in 50 years or more-- especially if you live in an older home developed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our air conditioning system and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition.
