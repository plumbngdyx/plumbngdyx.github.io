<p>Commercial kitchen waste disposal unit can be found in many different styles and horse power designs to handle a large range of volumes. Light responsibility garbage disposals are generally required in fast food dining establishments, corner store, delicatessens and office cooking areas.

<p>In this method, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get precipitated. Fast heating gas heaters, as a general rule, will heat water far faster than an electrical hot water heater of the same fundamental dimensions and capacity. An electric hot water heater may take a complete hour to heat 25 gallons, and a gas heater might heat two times that amount in the very same provided time and possibly faster.</p>
<p>Standard water softeners found in house supply and hardware stores will remove almost all the calcium and magnesium from the raw water during the softening procedure. Softeners also will eliminate as much as 10 parts per million (ppm) of iron and manganese. Water supplies with high levels of iron and manganese (greater than 10 ppm) might need pretreatment to extend the life expectancy of a water softener.
