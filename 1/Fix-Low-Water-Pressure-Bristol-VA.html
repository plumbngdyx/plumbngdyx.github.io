The consumer has one month to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (examine the due date on Notice of Requirements form). Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer might be needed to be found on the water service line, within the building, or both locations. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a recently set up backflow preventer, the water consumer is needed to have the backflow preventer tested on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
