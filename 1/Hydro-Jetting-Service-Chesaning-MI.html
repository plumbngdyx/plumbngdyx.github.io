<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regenerated, the beads become filled with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As tough water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. When water is heated, hard water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these symptoms.</p>

If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To avoid this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
