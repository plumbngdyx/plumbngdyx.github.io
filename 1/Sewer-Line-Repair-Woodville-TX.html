<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water flow, takes place. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite circulation is usually localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to escape. Often no apparent physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose shut down results in a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
