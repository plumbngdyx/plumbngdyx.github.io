<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked yearly. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be tested each year to guarantee the safety of the potable drinking water in your home.
