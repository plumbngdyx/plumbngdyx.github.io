All your drainpipes empty into the main sewer lines and when it is running correctly, it will stream to the city's sewer line.

<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the very first most obvious signs of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Despite whether it is an electrical water heater or a gas hot water heater, Premier Plumbing has offered hot water heater repair and installation service in the Hampton Roads area considering that 1978.</p>
