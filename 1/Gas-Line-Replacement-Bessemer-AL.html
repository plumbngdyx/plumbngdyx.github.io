The intent of electrical inspection is to guarantee compliance with the appropriate electrical code in order to decrease personal, and structural electrical dangers. The cost of the repair. The basic rule is that if the repair job will cost at least half as much as a new system, then you should replace it. However, if you're constantly calling us for repairs, the bills can rack up and break past that price point before you understand it.</p>
