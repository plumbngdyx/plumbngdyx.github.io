Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
