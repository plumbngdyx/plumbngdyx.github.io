<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>To the end user (consumer), SpringWell Water (SpringWell") warrants that the following Covered products- retention tanks and mineral tanks (14" or larger) shall be without any defects in material and craftsmanship for a period of 10-years under regular application, service and use. They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, but I offer the company props for contacting us to update us on the later arrival time. Some tasks take longer than expected, that's easy to understand, by keeping us notified of the slight hold-up, we didn't need to worry.</p>
