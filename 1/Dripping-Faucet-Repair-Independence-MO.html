<h3>Shower Repairs in Independence MO - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Because pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream backwards into the city water lines.</p>
