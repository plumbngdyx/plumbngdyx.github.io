<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Montpelier VT</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
