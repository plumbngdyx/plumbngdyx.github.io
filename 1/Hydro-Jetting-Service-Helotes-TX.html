Water utilized in recharging a water softener may overload or lower the efficiency of small septic or sewer systems. Sodium intake might posture health threats.

<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it challenging to get to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge job, changing exposed pipes in a basement, utility, or crawlspace  room is fairly straightforward, because the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets must definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet needs to be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>
