The performance of your toilet is determined in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more effective your toilet is. Discover if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were built prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing.

An ounce of prevention can mean the distinction in between having a functioning shower valve in the spare bathroom when visitors show up or having to call a plumber.</p>

<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is merely recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
