A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not frequently specified by water purveyors.  It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really important here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect versus back pressure.

After mounting the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
