<p>During the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This process continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered totally regrowed.</p>
