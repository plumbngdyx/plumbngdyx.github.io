<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it must put something back into the water.

This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank replenished.</p>
