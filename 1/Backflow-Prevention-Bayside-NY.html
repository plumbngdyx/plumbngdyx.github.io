<p>Last but not least, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five individually running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
