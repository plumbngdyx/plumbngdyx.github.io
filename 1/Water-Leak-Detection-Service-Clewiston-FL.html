For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and break or merely be so squished that it does not fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly recommend likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
