<p>Standpipe systems are used in numerous facilities, these systems are developed to offer water to fire hose connections or hose cabinets strategically installed inside a building. These systems usually are installed in large, open spaces within structures, and in multistory structures for the function of manual firefighting. Standpipe systems can offer early fire suppression in these structures making it capable for a single individual or firefighter to provide a quick and reliable  action to fire. There are 2 types of standpipe systems, the first type, are dry systems, which normally include no permanent water supply and are pressurized through a fire department connection by fire personnel reacting to an event. A dry standpipe system requires no backflow prevention security.

<p>The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the structure; additional, more significant costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for residents. A PE or RA can help identify if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss. Manufacturers of PVC or polyethylene gas piping and its linking fittings include Dormont, DriscoPlex, GasTite, Endot, Pro-Flex, Lyall Lyco, Yellowpipe, and others.</p>
<p>A simple repair or replacing private parts may be all that's needed to get your water heater working again if you have a more recent system. You may be tempted to bond or spot a leak shut or replace just a single area of pipe to conserve cash. While this may operate in the short term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the exact same product as other pipes in your house, implying that problem might be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you assurance and prevent bigger leakages down the road.</p>
