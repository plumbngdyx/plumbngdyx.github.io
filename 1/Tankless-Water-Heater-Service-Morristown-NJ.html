This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is essential to overcome the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its style and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it might be unwise in many scenarios to install a pipe sector of this length.

<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
