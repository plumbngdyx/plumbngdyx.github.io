<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks drinks. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

With a garbage disposal the garbage is managed through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device.
