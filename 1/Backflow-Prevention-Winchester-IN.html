When an individual ends up being a certified tester, there is a great chance the person knows how to check a backflow preventer.

The repair professional has a long list of things he must learn to be able to repair a backflow prevention assembly and return it to its initial factory requirements.</p>
<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if pricey) device is best used in critical locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
