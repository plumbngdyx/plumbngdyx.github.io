Polestar Plumbing, Heating & A/c is your reliable drain cleaning company.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a process called ion exchange to eliminate difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical procedure known as Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a solidity crystal that won't stick to any surface in your house, keeping your devices and hot water heaters free of difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also known as water conditioners because they do not really soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And because these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to remove caught ions.</p>
