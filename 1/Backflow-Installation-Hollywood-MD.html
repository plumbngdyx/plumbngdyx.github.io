There are several extra reports that also explain additional evidence of the firmness ions in a softener's regrowth waste causing less clogging and maintaining greater permeability than the routine septic system effluent.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
