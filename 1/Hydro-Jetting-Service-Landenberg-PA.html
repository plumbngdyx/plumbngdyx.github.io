Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
