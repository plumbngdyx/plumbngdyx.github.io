<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Littleton MA</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about a Pentair item or issues about your water, our customer support team is here to help you.
