Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no other way to supply one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed.

Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water functions are considered a health hazard if backflows occur from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place need to be suggested on construction strategies.

As soon as salt remains in water, there is no simple way to eliminate it.
