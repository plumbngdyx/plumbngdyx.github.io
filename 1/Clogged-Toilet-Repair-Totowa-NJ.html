<p>During the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine passes through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This procedure continues until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about fully regrowed.</p>
